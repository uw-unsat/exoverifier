The file "swapxor.c32sat" verifies that the following code fragment
in the programming language C swaps the values of x and y:

...
int x, y;
...
x ^= y;
y ^= x;
x ^= y;
/* The values of x and y have been swapped */
...

This code fragment needs no temporary variable for swapping. Only the
bitwise XOR operation is needed.

Call:
../../c32sat -t swapxor.c32sat
